This package creates diverse plots per day, weekday, month and year for peak demand power consumption of several meters. These plots lead to benefit-cost analyses and cost saving plots. In addition, this package forecasts peak power demand using ARIMA on a daily and monthly basis. Correlation and a simple regression are also included.
